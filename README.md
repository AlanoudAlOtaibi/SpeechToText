SpeechToText
Converting from Speech to Text with JavaScript :

The purpose of this is to experiment with the Web Speech API which enables you to incorporate voice data into web apps. The Web Speech API has two parts: 
SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech), 
and
 SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition.)

This app uses the Web Speech API to build a voice powered note app to do 3 things:

Takes notes by using voice-to-text or keyboard input.
Save voice notes to localStorage.
Display all of the saved notes and give the option to either Listen to the Notes or delete them.
